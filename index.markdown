title: "CS 448B: Data Visualizations Final Project"
---
Welcome to our project!

The dataset we chose to use was the Newspaper Navigator. The dataset includes different types of visual content such as images and maps from historical newspapers from 1850 to 1963. The object detection model used to compile the dataset recognizes data of the following types: Photograph, Illustration, Map, Comics/Cartoon, Editorial Cartoon, Headline, Advertisement. The dataset also includes textual information about the visual content itself, such as text content of a headline. There is also metadata regarding geographical location, newspaper information, dates, etc.

  This visualization shows the most common words/phrases from the photos datasets from each year from 1900 - 1946. We can use this visualization to see the most common words during the world wars and compare this to before and after the wars. The Top 30 topics from each year are listed in alphabetical order on the x-axis and the counts of the number of times these words appear is on the y-axis. It is interesting to see how the topic counts were so much higher in the 1910s and 1920s than in the 1930s and 1940s. This means there were many more photos from these decades than the decades after. The Great Depression was from 1929-1939. During this time, since the economy took a great downturn, it was likely there was less news printed and what could be considered unnecessary such as photos were removed from the newspapers. For example, the highest topic counts from 1915 were almost 6,000 and the highest topic counts from 1940 were around 500. Some interesting trends we noticed were that in years during the war, there were many mentions of other countries. For example in 1916, the words british, french, german, and mexico are all are displayed on the visualization. Other war related terms such as army are also only mentioned in war years.

 This visualization displays the proportion of ad types from the years 1900-1913 and 1919-1938. We can also see a chart with the years 1914-1918 & 1939-1946, wartime of WW1 and WW2 - TODO. Readers can hover over each pie slice to see an example of an ad that is in that category. We can use this to compare the popularity of ad types in war and out of war. We can see that fashion is the most popular ad type both in wartime and in peacetime, with home ads coming in close second, and food in third. It is interesting to see the differences in the rest of the ad types in war and out of war.

 During wartime, advertising focuses on essentials like food, home needs, and services. This reflects the eras priorities such as rationing, healthcare, and stability. Fashion remains relevant but emphasizes practicality, while transportation and entertainment ads decline due to resource conservation and limited leisure activities. In peacetime, the focus shifts toward consumerism, with fashion and home ads dominating as people invest in luxury goods and improvements. Food ads decrease in prominence as rationing ends, and transportation and entertainment ads recover, reflecting increased mobility and leisure activities. Overall, wartime ads highlight necessity and resilience, while peacetime ads reflect prosperity and consumerism.

 By clicking on the fashion category, readers are also able to see the difference in men and women targeted fashion ads. During wartime, fashion advertisements often focused more on men, reflecting their central role in the war effort and the influence of military styles on civilian attire. Ads for men highlighted durable, practical clothing like uniforms, sturdy suits, and boots, emphasizing patriotism and resilience. Women’s fashion during these periods was often constrained by fabric rationing, leading to simpler, utilitarian designs and fewer advertisements. In contrast, peacetime brought a shift toward women’s fashion as America sought to rebuild normalcy, with ads celebrating femininity, elegance, and luxury. Economic recovery allowed for greater spending on elaborate styles and accessories, and women, as key household consumers, became the primary target for fashion marketers. Men’s fashion ads during peacetime declined in prominence, focusing instead on leisure and business attire. These shifts reflect the broader social and economic dynamics of wartime and peacetime, as well as evolving gender roles and priorities.
