Welcome to our project!

The dataset we chose to use was the Newspaper Navigator. The dataset includes different types of visual content such as images and maps from historical newspapers from 1850 to 1963. The object detection model used to compile the dataset recognizes data of the following types: Photograph, Illustration, Map, Comics/Cartoon, Editorial Cartoon, Headline, Advertisement. The dataset also includes textual information about the visual content itself, such as text content of a headline. There is also metadata regarding geographical location, newspaper information, dates, etc.

  This visualization shows the most common words/phrases from the photos datasets from each year from 1900 - 1946. We can use this to see what words were most common during the world wars and compare this to before and after the wars. It is interesting to see how the counts for the topic counts were so much higher in the 1910s and 1920s which means that there were many more photos then. The Great Depression was from 1929-1939. During this time, since the economy took a great downturn, it was likely there was less news printed and what could be considered unnecessary such as photos were removed from the newspapers. For example, the highest numbers from 1910 were ___ and the highest numbers from 1940 were ____.
